Define methods that Platforms should publish to be accesible via a generic fdc3Access instance. 

A platform can chose to implement any subset of methods that make sense for its implementation, the only method it is required to publish is the Fdc3GetPlatformInfo method.

The methods are typically implemented by a FDC3 Manager and/or a Toolbar/Launcher which may have connected to one or more FDC3  App Directory servers.

The methods are grouped into the following Categories. 

App Definitions:
  Fdc3ListApplications();   // Return a  list of applications. This an Interop version of the App Directory REST service.
  Fdc3GetApplicationDetails - Return details of an application.

App Management:
  Fdc3StartApplication. - Generic start method.

  Fdc3StartApplication<AppType> - A method to launch a specific type of application
    e.g. Fdc3StartApplicationExe and Fdc3StartApplicationBrowser
 
  Fdc3ListAppInstances - Get a list of application instances (== Running apps) for a given Application.

  Fdc3ActivateAppInstance - Activate (give Focus and bring to front) an App Instance

Intents:
  Fdc3GetIntentsByName
  Fdc3GetIntentsByContextType
  Fdc3GetIntentsByContext
  
  But also methods are tagged on a Platform so 
  Fdc3RxIntent<IntentName> e.g. Fdc3RxIntentShowChart

Context:
  Fdc3RxContext  - Receive broadcast of a new Context.
  Fdc3GetContext - Get the current context for the Platform.

Misc:  
  Fdc3GetPlatformInfo
