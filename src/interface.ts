 * fdc3Access instance. Applications may also instantiate their own instances which connect directly 
 * to the Platforms.
 * 
 * The current FDC3 services available via fdc3Access are :
 *  - Application management, which covers launching and activating applications. It is expected that the 
 * applictions available will have been read from one or more App Directory services but this is NOT a requirement.
 * NB SHould we include the enumerate apps here or leave that to the AppD REST API (my vote).
 *   - Intents, listing Intents and firing them.
 *   - Contexts, broadcasting 'current context' to interested applications.
 * 
 * The definitions of Applications, Intents and Contexts follow the proposals from the various FDC3 Working groups.
 * At some point in the future this interface can reference approved and (versioned) definitiosn from the WG's
 * in this iteration, the appropriate definitions have been copied in here to enable this to be a self contained
 * proposal.
 * 
 * Usage Note: Identity and Secutiry are key issues to be addressed in a future iteration.
