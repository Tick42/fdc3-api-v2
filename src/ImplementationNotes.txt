Note on implementing the various interface methods when managing a set of Platforms.
This is related to the Artchitecture.txt and will probably merge into one document.

openApplication(app: string|Application, context?: Context, config?: string, platform?: string|Platform):
   Promise<ApplicationInstance>;

For a valid application, The FDC3 instance needs to invoke one of
     Fdc3StartApplication. - Generic start method.

     Fdc3StartApplication<AppType> - A method to launch a specific type of application
 On the appropriate method.

 The easiest way to do that is for the FDC3 instance to hold the merged map of all the Application Directories
 but this is a big data set to hold for each application instance.
 Instead I see two possible solutions:
 A. If the openApplication is paased on Application instance this describes the application type and the Platform 
 that supports the application. So the FDC3 Instance can use the following logic:
    - If the Platform exports a method of Fdc3StartApplication<AppType> then call that method.
    - If not then If the Platform exports Fdc3StartApplication call that.
    - If the Platform exports multiple start app methods then this is a config error.

B. If the client just passes a string then we have the name of the app, and the FDC3 instance looks for implementations of
Fdc3FindApplication on all supported Platforms and then :
- If Platform parameter is specified, restrict search to that Platform else search all connected Platforms.
- If noone knows the app - fail.
- If only one instance - Launch using loigc from Step A.
- If multiple matches - Fail with appropriate error message.
