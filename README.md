# fdc3-api-v2
Proposed FDC3 Application API

src\interface.ts contains the proposed FDC3 client API to work with starting applications, Intents and Contexts.

The interface can be implemented  by any Platform using any architecture that is appropriate to that Platform, 
however this repo also contains detailed notes on implementing the API across multiple Platforms using a set 
of standardised Interop methods (link to Plexus Interop project). 

After discussion this repo will be split into two, one containing the API and the other containing an open source implementation of the API that utilises the Interop methods specified.
